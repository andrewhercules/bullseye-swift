## Bull's Eye (Swift)

### Introduction

Bull's Eye is a basic iOS application developed using Swift, Apple's new programming language. The tutorial is part of the iOS Apprentice Series from [RayWenderlich.com](http://raywenderlich.com). It's a fairly simple app - a number is randomly generated, the player has to place a bull's eye on a slider, and they earn points based on how close the bull's eye is to the number. The player can continue to play and accumulate points and can also reset the game.

### Languages/Platforms/Tools

* Swift
* Xcode

### Learning Outcomes

After purchsing the iOS Apprentice Series, my main goal was to learn more about Swift and to better understand how to develop stable and dynamic apps for iOS devices. Although I had previously worked with Swift when developing [Pointr](https://github.com/HatStephens/pointr_iOS_FinalProjectApp) for a final project at Maker's Academy, I wanted to go through a tutorial that went 'back to basics' as I wanted to really understand the foundations of Swift. For example, I now understand the role of ! and ? and how to better understand the scope/availability of variables inside and outside of functions. I also feel more comfortable using different methods to create connections between the code in a view controller file and elements in the main storyboard view. 

### To-do list

- [x] Complete tutorial and add web/HTML view
- [x] Add constraints so that storyboard view is dynamic based on screen size

### Instructions

Clone the repository, open the project file in Xcode, and run in the iOS Simulator:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:andrewhercules/bullseye-swift.git
```
