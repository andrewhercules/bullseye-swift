## Bull's Eye (Swift)

### Introduction

Bull's Eye is a basic iOS application developed using Swift, Apple's new programming language for iOS and OS devices. The tutorial is part of the iOS Apprentice Series.

### Languages/Platforms/Tools

* Swift
* Xcode

### Learning Outcomes

After purchsing the iOS Apprentice Series, my main goal is to learn more about Swift to better understand how to develop stable and dynamic apps for iOS devices. Although I had previously worked with Swift when developing [Pointr](https://github.com/HatStephens/pointr_iOS_FinalProjectApp) for a final project at Maker's Academy, I appreciated that with this tutorial, I went 'back to basics' to better understand the foundations of Swift. For example, I now understand the role of ! and ? and how to better understand the scope/availability of variables inside and outside of functions. 

### To-do list

- [ ] Complete tutorial and add web/HTML view
- [ ] Add constraints so that storyboard view is dynamic based on screen size

### Instructions

Clone the repository, open the project file in Xcode, and run in the iOS Simulator:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:andrewhercules/bullseye-swift.git
```
